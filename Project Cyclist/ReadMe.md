# Cylistic

Cyclistic is a case study from Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study. I use cyclistic data in the April 2020 period. Here I try to explore the data.

First I tried to tidy up the data that I downloaded in Microsoft Excel, then added the day_of_week and ride_length columns. For day_of_week I use the WEEKDAY function and for ride_length is the result of subtracting the column ended_at minus started_at and then multiplied by 1440. After tidying up the data in Microsoft Excel I tried to explore data in Microsoft SQL Server. After I did some exploration I tried to visualize it on the tableau.

Tools: Microsoft Excel, SSMS, and Tableau
