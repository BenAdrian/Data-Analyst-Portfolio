# airbnb NYC 2019
[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), as in "Air Bed and Breakfast" is a service that lets property owners rent out their spaces to travellers looking for a place to stay. Travelers can rent a space for multiple people to share, a shared space with private rooms, or the entire property for themselves.

## Overview
The data set I took it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) Airbnb NYC, NY 2019. In this project, the data set describes the listing activity and metrics. This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions. We are going to find the answer to questions like:
- Where are the most properties in NYC?
- What is the average price for an Airbnb room in NYC?
- Who is the host with the most property owned in NYC?

Tools: The tools that I used for this analysis are SQL and Tableau for the visualization.
