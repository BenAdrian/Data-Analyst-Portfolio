# Overview
The data set I took it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/video-game-sales-and-ratings) The Video Games Sales and Ratings Dataset provides an in-depth view into the dynamic world of video games, offering a comprehensive analysis of sales and ratings across diverse platforms and publishers. This dataset contains valuable facets of information that bring to light various insights about the video game industry over the years. The dataset includes critical aspects such as the Name of each individual video game which was accounted for in this data aggregation process. The name captures the branded title under which a specific game is marketed and sold within the global market.


Tools: The tools that I used for this analysis are SQL and Tableau for the visualization.
