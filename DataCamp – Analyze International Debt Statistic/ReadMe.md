# DataCamp â€“ Analyze International Debt Statistic

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is an online learning platform that helps students build data skills at their own pace. DataCamp courses include non-coding essentials like BI tools to data science and machine learning.

## Overview
This data set is provided by DataCamp where they took it the data set from The World Bank. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.
We are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories, like country_name, country_code, indicator_name, indicator_code, and debt. We are going to find the answers to questions like:
- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

Tools: The tool that I use for this analysis is SQL that has been provided by DataCamp in their website.
